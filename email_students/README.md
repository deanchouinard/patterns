**From a Dave Thomas tweet: 12/7/16**
He comments: Programming by pipeline. Transformative!


Rather than just read the code, I took Mr. Thomas's example and filled in some of the details

I had to add a few libraries to fill in the capabilities of the system. I choose based upon the API I could surmise from the provided code:

* CSV: [CSV](https://hexdocs.pm/csv/overview.html)
* Mail: [bamboo](https://hexdocs.pm/bamboo/readme.html)
